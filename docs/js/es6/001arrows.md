### Arrows
Arrows are a function shorthand using the `=>` syntax.  They are syntactically similar to the related feature in C#, Java 8 and CoffeeScript.  They support both statement block bodies as well as expression bodies which return the value of the expression.  Unlike functions, arrows share the same lexical `this` as their surrounding code.

```JavaScript
// Expression bodies
var odds = evens.map(v => v + 1);
var nums = evens.map((v, i) => v + i);
var pairs = evens.map(v => ({even: v, odd: v + 1}));

// Statement bodies
nums.forEach(v => {
  if (v % 5 === 0)
    fives.push(v);
});

// Lexical this
var bob = {
  _name: "Bob",
  _friends: [],
  printFriends() {
    this._friends.forEach(f =>
      console.log(this._name + " knows " + f));
  }
}
```
