### Testing

  - **Yup.**

    ```javascript
    function () {
      return true;
    }
    ```

  - **No, but seriously**:
   - Whichever testing framework you use, you should be writing tests!
   - Strive to write many small pure functions, and minimize where mutations occur.
   - Be cautious about stubs and mocks - they can make your tests more brittle.
   - We primarily use [`mocha`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) at Airbnb. [`tape`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape) is also used occasionally for small, separate modules.
   - 100% test coverage is a good goal to strive for, even if it's not always practical to reach it.
   - Whenever you fix a bug, _write a regression test_. A bug fixed without a regression test is almost certainly going to break again in the future.
